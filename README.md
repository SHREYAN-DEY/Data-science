This repo serves as a personal log and workshop for my data science learning endeavor. This is the place where I organize my code, notes and projects as a aquire new skills.

### Current Focus :
I'm currently exploring deep trenches of NumPy to understand its root funtionalities.

### Environmental Setup :
To maintain a clean and isonated dev env all dependencies are installed within a virtual envirtonment.
