This repo serves as a personal log and workshop for my data science learning endeavor. This is the place where I organize my code, notes and projects as a aquire new skills.

### Current Focus :
I'm currently exploring deep trenches of Matplotlib to understand its root funtionalities.

### Achived Goals :
Numpy, Pandas

### Next Goals :
Seaborn, Data source(Databases, internet,APIs),etc..

### Environmaltal Setup :
To maintain a clean and isonated dev env all dependencies are installed within a virtual envirtonment.

### Source of Info :
In this journey all the informations I am leaning is solely from books, free courses and vast open internet. Basically I wanted to say that I am self-learning.
